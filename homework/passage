We present  framework for automatically ordering image patches that enables in-depth analysis  dataset relationship to learnability   classification task using convolutional neural network. An image patch is  group  pixels residing in  continuous area contained in  sample. Our preliminary experimental results show that an informed smart shuffling  patches at  sample level can expedite training by exposing important features at early stages  training. In addition, we conduct systematic experiments  provide evidence that CNNâ€™s generalization capabilities do not correlate with human recognizable features present in training samples. We utilized  framework not only to show that spatial locality  features within samples do not correlate with generalization, but also to expedite convergence while achieving similar generalization performance. Using multiple network architectures  datasets, we show that ordering image regions using mutual information measure between adjacent patches, enables CNNs to converge in  third   total steps required to train  same network without patch ordering, baby, baby, baby, baby, babies, babies, babies, babies, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaves, leaves, leaves, leaves, leaves, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wives, wives, wives, wives, wives, wives
